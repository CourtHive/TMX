/**
 * DEPRECATED: Legacy scoring modal (V1)
 * 
 * This file has been deprecated in favor of scoringV2 with dynamicSets approach.
 * The new scoring system provides:
 * - Better validation with matchUpFormat support
 * - Irregular ending handling (RET/WO/DEF)
 * - Multiple input approaches (freeText and dynamicSets)
 * - Comprehensive test coverage
 * - Better TypeScript types
 * 
 * Migration: All scoring now uses scoringModalV2 from components/modals/scoringV2
 * 
 * Original file preserved for reference during transition period.
 * This file is no longer imported or used by the application.
 * 
 * @deprecated Use scoringModalV2 instead
 * @see src/components/modals/scoringV2
