# Release-path scope: is this PR on the release path, changing nothing but version files?
#
# Two PRs make up the release path, and neither carries code:
#   (a) release-please's PR into the release branch (head `release-please--*`);
#   (b) the back-merge PR, release branch -> `dev`, opened by back-merge.yml after a publish.
# Both change only the files release-please writes. The tree under them was verified when it
# landed, so a version-only diff skips the heavy gates while every job still reports its check.
# Decided by the DIFF, not the branch name: either PR touching anything else gets the full run.
# Mirrors the factory's Release-PR scope step (#5169(factory)).
#
# Prints `light=true|false`, and appends it to $GITHUB_OUTPUT when that is set.
# Inputs (env): EVENT_NAME, HEAD_REF, BASE_REF, HEAD_REPO, REPO. The diff is FROM..TO, by default
# HEAD^1..HEAD: a pull_request checkout is the PR's merge commit, whose first parent is the base
# tip, so that diff is exactly what the PR brings in. The checkout needs `fetch-depth: 2`.
#
# Test against history (a release commit is light, a code commit is not):
#   EVENT_NAME=pull_request HEAD_REF=release-please--x BASE_REF=main HEAD_REPO=r REPO=r \
#     FROM=<sha>^ TO=<sha> bash .github/scripts/release-scope.sh
