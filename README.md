# TMX

Tournament Management exTreme, or, because it works with data standards (TODS) and an ethos of collaborative development: ethodseXtensible Tournament Manager.

## Origin

TMX began as a data visualization project; a small component of a large ecosystem of tennis data visualizations. Re-presentation of draw data pulled from PDFs turned into an effort to improve capture of tournament results, and one thing led to another.  The business rules of the original TMX have been refined over the years and are nov available as the Competition Factory. This repo represents an in-process tear-down and restructuring of code which charts the journey from rank novice to no-longer-novice.
